We use Matrix/Riot chat in order to communicate. Our channel is open to the public, and also bridged with an IRC channel on Freenode.

* Chat with us at [#philly2600:phillymesh.net](https://chat.phillymesh.net/#/room/#philly2600:phillymesh.net){:target="_blank"}
* Used the bridged IRC channel at [Freenode/#philly2600](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23philly2600&uio=d4)

We also have a separate Discord group chat set up.

* Chat in the Discord group at [discordapp.com/invite/fATAd44](https://discordapp.com/invite/fATAd44)


The older IRC channel is still used by some people, but does not have much active discussion.

* Chat at the [2600Net/#philly2600 channel](ircs://irc.2600.net:6697/philly2600)
