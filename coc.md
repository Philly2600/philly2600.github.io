We are committed to making Philly 2600 an inclusive and welcoming meetup for everyone.

Sadly, technology communities have a notorious reputation for harassment. We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable participating.

Everyone who attends Philly2600 is required to abide by this code of conduct, both at any event and on any online channels. We will not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory behaviour of any form. Specifically:

* Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behaviour. *ANY* prejudiced behaviour.
* Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, or sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent. Absence of "no" is not "yes".
* Every participant's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone alone, you must respect this.
* Aggression and elitism are not welcome â€” nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

If you break these rules, we may ban you from the meetup at our discretion.

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, or have any comments or queries, you can get in touch with us in the following ways:

* Reach out to Mike D in-person at a meetup.
* Send a direct message to the @Philly2600 Twitter account.

Our meetups take place in a public area. Nobody is excluded. There is no admission charge or dues of any sort. We have nothing to hide and we don't presume to judge who is worthy of attending and who is not. We act in a responsible manner. We don't do illegal things and we don't cause problems for the place we're meeting in.
