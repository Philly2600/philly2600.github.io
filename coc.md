We meet in a public area. Nobody is excluded. There is no admission charge or dues of any sort. It's preferable to have meetings in as 
open a spot as possible rather than behind closed doors. This ensures that new people who don't know about the meetings will be drawn in. 
We have nothing to hide and we don't presume to judge who is worthy of attending and who is not. If law enforcement harasses us, it will 
backfire as it did at the infamous Washington DC meeting in 11/92.

We act in a responsible manner. We don't do illegal things and we don't cause problems for the place we're meeting in. *Most* 2600 meetings are welcomed by the establishments we choose.

_Based on the [2600 Meeting Guidelines](https://www.2600.com/meetings/guidelines.html){:target="_blank"}_.
