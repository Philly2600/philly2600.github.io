The tech scene in Philadelphia is booming. We have local startups like [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [TicketLeap](http://www.ticketleap.com/), and we have co-working spaces like [Indy Hall](http://www.indyhall.org/) and [Philly Game Forge](https://technical.ly/philly/2013/10/03/philly-game-forge-old-city-coworking/). We have hackathons like [Apps for Philly Transit](http://appsforphilly.org/events/transit-2013) and [Start-up Weekend Health](http://healthphl.startupweekend.org/), and we have hackerspaces like [Hive 76](http://www.hive76.org/) and [Devnuts](http://devnuts.com/). We have user groups like [PLUG](http://www.phillylinux.org/) and [PSSUG](http://www.pssug.org/), and we have conferences like [Fosscon](http://fosscon.org/) and [PumpCon](http://pumpcon.org/). We have events like [Philly Tech Week](http://www.phillytechweek.com/) and [TEDxPhilly](http://www.tedxphilly.com/), and we have security meet-ups like [PhillySec](http://www.phillysec.com/) and, yeah, *Philly 2600*. The hacker spirit is alive and well in the city of brotherly love, but where did all of this pro-hacker sentiment come from? What came before to help shape our current tech-centric landscape?

It's surprisingly difficult to approach the topic from the present day. I haven't been there since the beginning, and the breadcrumbs left over from the era are few and far between. We are left with hints though, but usually from more analog sources. The first issue of 2600 that includes meeting times is volume 10, issue 2, from 1993. Philly 2600 is listed here with numerous others (making the meeting at least 20 years old), but how long did the meeting exist before this? We also know that [Bernie S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_S), longtime 2600 affiliate, was the founder of the Philadelphia 2600 chapter. Other than that, there is little to find on paper.

But what else can we dig up? We do have some other little tidbits of information that apply themselves to the history of Philly 2600. The film [Freedom Downtime](http://www.freedomdowntime.com/) (2001) has some footage [taking place at Stairway #7 of 30th Street Station](http://www.2600.com/easter/eggs.html), the original meeting location. There are also mentions of the meeting in the book [Hacker Diaries: Confessions of Teenage Hackers](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hacker-Diaries-Confessions-Teenage/dp/0072223642) (2002), where one story places a student at the 30th Street meeting in the late 1990's. More recent references, such as the current 2600 magazine meeting listings have the meeting location moved to the southeast corner of the food court - the location used previous to the current location some 50 feet away.

But what about the people who attended? It's hard to keep track of this aspect, and as time goes on people come and go. Some come for one meeting and are never seen again, but some stick around a while. Eventually, there are no remains of the previous group - the meeting goes through generations. We can get a little information from simple web searches. Old Usenet listings can be a great source for material, [here's a Philadelphia 2600 meeting announcement from 1995 by The Professor](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.2600/pXp34r14398/HW0olGxQ_YUJ). Even more interesting, [here's a Phrack article](http://phrack.org/issues/45/9.html#article) by Emmanuel Goldstein (publisher of 2600) talking about how he and three others brought [Mark Abene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Abene) (Phiber Optik) to the Philly 2600 meeting before having to drop him off at federal prison in Schuylkill.

Using Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/), we can get an interesting perspective on the members from ten years ago by visiting an archived version of the old website (also at this domain). This is actually something we can explore. It appears that as of mid 2002 to regulars were JQS, Kepi Blanc, Damiend LaTao, Dj`Freak, The Good Revrend Nookie Freak, and GodEmperor Daeymion. Before this, regulars included Satanklawz (former site admin at the time) and Starkweather before the site was passed on to Kepi Blanc. The archived website offers an incredible amount of information such as a [WiFi map](http://web.archive.org/web/20020207100704/http://philly2600.net/wirelessmap/) of the city, several [papers](http://web.archive.org/web/20011221102311/http://www.philly2600.net/intpap.html), and even (incredibly tiny thumbnails of) [meeting photos](http://web.archive.org/web/20020207042046/http://philly2600.net/mtgpix.html). It's clunky and full of imperfections but this website offers a time-capsule-like look into Philly 2600's past.

But what about other hacker origins in the area?

We know of *Pumpcon*, one of the USA's first hacker conferences started in 1993 (almost as old as [DEF CON](http://www.defcon.org/)). Pumpcon has been running for over 20 years with an invite-only status. It is often overshadowed and left in the dust by the larger conferences in the country, despite its stature as one of the first of its kind. Pumpcon has not been exclusively held in Philadelphia since its inception. The conference has previously been held in Greenburgh, New York and Pittsburgh. Pumpcon has no central repository of information (why would it?) but a lot of history can be found scouring the web through old ezine articles like [this one about Pumpcon being busted](http://textfiles.com/hacking/pumpcon.txt) and notices like [this one announcing Pumpcon VI](http://servv89pn0aj.sn.sourcedns.com/~gbpprorg/l0pht/spacerog/PumpVIa.html). I'm currently compiling as many of these resources as I can, but there is an immense amount of data to sift through. Below I have some hard copy from my collection: A review of Pumpcon II from the publication *Gray Areas* and the incredibly recent Pumpcon 2012 announcement.

Other groups are harder to find. Numerous groups started up, burned brightly, and were then extinguished. Who knows where those people are now or the extent of what they accomplished. There are of course a few leftovers. One of my own pet projects is [the development of an archive of older hacker magazines](http://anarchivism.org/w/Category:Zines). A previously popular publication in particular, Blacklisted! 411, sheds a little light on some long-lost Philly hackers. A few issues make reference to Blacklisted! meetings taking place at Suburban Station in Philadelphia and another at the Granite Run Mall run by thegreek[at]hygnet[dot]com (long defunct) in neighboring Delaware County (and surprisingly about five minutes from my house). The earliest occurrence of these meetings I can find of this is in volume 3, issue 3 from August 1996 but either may have started earlier.

There are a few other loose ends as well. The recent book [Exploding The Phone](http://explodingthephone.com/) (2013) by Phil Lapsley catalogs the beginnings of the phreak culture, and makes reference to several fone phreaks in PA, some more notable than others, including Philadelphia native David Condon and some unidentified friends of [John Draper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper) (Cap'n Crunch) around the time he was busted by Pennsylvania Bell. We additionally know that some of the main scenes in the previously mentioned *Freedom Downtime* were filmed in Philadelphia. We also know that there are were [**hundreds**](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/215/) of hacker bulletin board systems in the area from the 1980's through the 1990's.

Let's change gears now. Our main problem in moving forward is what we do not know. Stories and events have been lost as time goes one, and the hopes of finding them becomes dimmer with each passing year.

If you had some involvement with the Philadelphia hacking scene in the years past, tell someone. Talk to me. Let me interview you. Get your story out there. Share your experiences - I'm all ears.

Those of you out there hosting meetings and starting projects, keep a record of what you're doing. This is my one request.

We've already lost a lot of history. Let's try saving some.
